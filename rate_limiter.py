### Example Scenario

Let's assume the following:
- A client with IP `192.168.1.1` makes requests to an endpoint.
- The rate limit is set to 5 requests per 60 seconds.

1. **First Request**: The client makes their first request.
    - The current timestamp is `1609459200` (just an example timestamp).
    - The sorted set key `rate_limit:192.168.1.1` is checked. Since this is the first request, it's added to the set.
    - The count of requests in the set is now 1, which is less than the limit of 5. The request is allowed.

2. **Subsequent Requests**: The client makes four more requests within the next 60 seconds.
    - Each request adds a new timestamp to the sorted set and checks the count.
    - As long as the count doesnâ€™t exceed 5, the requests are allowed.

3. **Sixth Request**: If the client makes a sixth request within the same 60-second window:
    - The count of timestamps in the set would be 6, which exceeds the limit.
    - The function returns `False`, indicating the rate limit has been exceeded, and the request should be denied.
